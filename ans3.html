The <button> HTML element is a versatile and widely used element that represents a clickable button. It can perform a variety of actions depending on its attributes and the context in which it is used.

    The type attribute specifies the type of button, and it can have the following values:
    
     Submit: The button submits the form data to the server when clicked. This is the default value if the type attribute is not specified.
     Reset: The button resets all the fields in the form to their initial values. This is used to clear all user inputs in the form.
     Button: The button does not perform any action by default. It can be used with JavaScript to perform custom actions when clicked.
